WELCOME!!

The time has come for YOU to make a Hangman game!
I have started for you here, but there is a lot of functionality missing.
My challenge for you is to build on this and make the greatest Hangman game ever.

SHARING IS CARING!

I would love to see all your solutions to this, and to share your project, simply do the following:

- Make a github account
- Go to https://github.com/kristine-sl/Hangman
- Fork the project (press the "fork" button on the top right)
- Clone the project to your computer with your own link
- (Have fun learning how to use Github)
- Make changes, have fun, and then push those to your repo
- Make sure the repo is public, and then post a link to it to the forum on ITL under
Programmering 1 (PG1100-14) / Repetisjonsforelesninger

THE POSSIBILITIES ARE (ALMOST) ENDLESS

Some suggestions to functionality you can add:
  
- Saving of already guessed letters
- Not allowing the user to guess (and get points for) a letter he / she have previously guessed.
- Give the user feedback on whether or not the guess is correct
- Showing the user where in the word the character is located
     (Example: 
     "You guessed: E
     This is correct!
     _ E _ _ E _ _ _ _ _")
- Make an illustration of the hanged man
- Show the user guesses he made that weren't correct 
     (Exampe: 
     "You guessed: E
     This is correct!
     _ E _ _ E _ _ _ _ _"
     "Wrong guesses: C, K, P)
- Ask the user if he / she wants to play again 
    - Count wins and losses and display this to the user
